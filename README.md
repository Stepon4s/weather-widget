# Weather Widget Project

This project is a **responsive web-based weather widget** that provides real-time weather updates. The widget is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and fetches data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

## Key Features

- **City Search**: Users can input the name of any city to get the current weather conditions for that location.
- **Dynamic Display**: The widget dynamically displays the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the searched city.
- **Weather Icons**: The widget includes visually appealing weather icons that change based on the current weather conditions (e.g., rain, clear, clouds, drizzle, mist, snow).
- **Error Handling**: The widget handles errors gracefully. If a user enters an invalid city name, the widget provides a visual response and prompts the user to enter a valid city name.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates my skills in **web development**, **API integration**, and **user interface design**. It also showcases my ability to create a user-friendly and interactive web application that provides valuable real-time information.
